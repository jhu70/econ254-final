  \begin{abstract}
  An important principle of economics is that people respond to
  incentives. For that reason, government and organizations implement
  incentives to encourage prosocial behavior. This paper looks at how
  monetary and nonmonetary incentives change people's decisions to act
  prosocially, and how these effects differ across gender. It will start
  by discussing the paper about the effect of monetary incentives on
  charity donations, and will then look at the literature on the drivers
  of prosocial behavior and the effectiveness of incentives. Lastly, we
  will tackle unanswered questions by suggesting a more comprehensive
  experimental design that addresses the gaps in the literature by
  considering a new population. \par

\section{1. Introduction}\label{introduction}

\section{2. Main paper}\label{main-paper}

\section{3. Reproduction of}\label{reproduction-of}

The following section will discuss the reproduction of all the relevant
figures, p-values and regression results to ``Click for Charity''
experiment presented in the paper. The discussed regression tables are
at the end of the paper, and the relevant regression for the mentioned
p-values can be found in the appendix. We weren't able to replicate the
results for ``Bike for Charity'' as the data was not available.

As in the, the analysis of the results will focus first on the good
cause and the bad cause cases separately in two figures below and then
finally analyze of all causes together by running an OLS regression. The
two figures below are substantially similar and don't differ graphically
from the original paper's.

Figure 1 below summarizes the effort of participants for the cause in
the public and private conditions, with and without incentives. The
first panel (A) defines the good cause by the participant's perception
of the cause, while the second panel (B) defines it by the consensus of
the Princeton students (Red Cross for the good cause). The figure shows
the average number of keypresses and their standard errors by payment
scheme and visibility of the participation. The quantitative results are
consistent across both panels. Firstly, in support of the Image
motivation hypothesis, we see that without incentives, participants
produce more effort in the public conditions. The difference was
significant at the 5\% and 1\% level for panel A and B respectively. The
introduction of monetary incentives does not increase the effort in the
public conditions, but does so in private condition. In the public
condition, there is a non-statistically significant decline
(p\textgreater{}0.3 for both panels) in effort. In the private
condition, there is a significant increase (p=0.048 and p=0.023 for
panel A and B respectively) in effort. These results support the
effectiveness hypothesis.

The same analysis is replicated below for the bad cause. We observe that
without incentives, there is no significant difference
(p\textgreater{}0.44 for both panels) between the effort produced in the
public and private conditions. When given monetary incentives, we
observe the same results as for the good cause. In the public condition,
there is non-significant effect on effort (p\textgreater{}0.6 for both
panels). In the private condition, we observe an increase in effort, but
this difference in effectiveness across the two different visibilities
is significant for panel A (p=0.07) but not for panel B (p=0.32).

To analyze the two causes together, the following OLS regression tables
(Table 1 and 2) analyze how the private/public conditions affect the
number of pressed key pairs, which reflects the effort produced. The
first table controls for the perceived identification of others, and the
second controls for American Red Cross and NRA. The first column of both
tables show that monetary incentives increase effort in the private
conditions, which doesn't hold in the public condition as column 2
shows. The two tables also show the importance of the cause, especially
in the public conditions. The third columns, which combines the public
and private conditions, reinforces the previous stated results about the
effect of monetary incentives and the nature of the cause on the level
of effort. Overall, the coefficients of our table and their statistical
significance match the paper's results while our t-values differ
slightly from those in the paper. Two coefficients had different
significance levels in our results- one was significant at the 1\% level
in our table while it was significant at the 5\% level in the paper's
table, and the opposite was true for the other. We believe this change
is due that the p-values are close to the cutoff between the two
significance levels, so the difference might be due to the use of a
difference statistical software.
